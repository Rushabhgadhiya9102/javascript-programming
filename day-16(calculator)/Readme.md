Event Listeners:

A forEach loop is used to add a click event listener to each button.
The event listener captures the button's inner text and performs actions based on the button clicked.
Button Functionality
Equal Button (=):

Evaluates the expression in the display using eval() and updates the display with the result.
Clear Button (AC):

Clears the display by setting its value to an empty string.
Backspace Button (X):

Removes the last character from the display using slice().
Other Buttons:

Appends the button's value (number or operator) to the display.
4. Dependencies
Bootstrap: The application uses Bootstrap 5.3.3 for styling and layout. The CSS and JS files are linked via CDN.
5. Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on the buttons to input numbers and operations.
Use the = button to calculate the result.
Use AC to clear the display or X to delete the last input.
6. Notes
The use of eval() can be risky if the input is not controlled, as it can execute arbitrary code. In a production environment, consider implementing a safer evaluation method.
The calculator currently supports basic arithmetic operations and can be extended with additional functionalities as needed.
